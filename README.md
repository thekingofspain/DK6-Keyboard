# DK6-Keyboard
DuMang DK6 Keyboard from BeyondQ/Velocifire

The Repository for now, is for sharing information, recording issues, workarounds, and feature requests for the DK6 Keyboard from [BeyoundQ](http://www.beyondq.com/%E8%B6%85%E9%85%B7%E7%A7%91%E6%8A%80-%E4%BA%A7%E5%93%81-%E6%AF%92%E8%9F%92%E9%94%AE%E7%9B%98-%E6%A8%A1%E5%9D%97%E5%8C%96%E9%94%AE%E7%9B%98-dk6-dumang.html) and [Velocifire](https://www.velocifiretech.com/product/dumang-dk6-ergo-v2/)

This repository has no connection to BeyoundQ and Velocifire.  The hopes are the information in the repository will influence the direction of DuMang DK6 firmware and software toward a more feature rich platform compareable to other keyboard platforms([QMK](https://qmk.fm/)/[TMK](https://github.com/tmk/tmk_keyboard)/[VIA](https://caniusevia.com/)) and fully leverage amazing DK6 hardware.
